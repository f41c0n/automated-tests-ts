Feature: The Basics
  As a visitor
  I should be able to type my name into input
  So that I can see greetings with my name

  Scenario Outline: Protractor and Cucumber Test
    Given I go to Angular home page
    When I add "<userName>" in the input field
    Then I should see "Hello <userName>!"

      | userName |
      |  Marcin  |
      |  Jan     |
